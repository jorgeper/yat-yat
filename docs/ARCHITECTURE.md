# Yat Yat Architecture

## Pipeline

```
Right ⌘ (handy-keys event tap)
   └─> pipeline.rs   Idle → Recording → Processing state machine (1 thread, serialized)
         ├─ audio.rs        cpal @ device native rate → mono downmix → RMS levels (~30 Hz)
         │                  → on stop: rubato resample to 16 kHz mono
         ├─ overlay.rs      non-activating pill (NSPanel), waveform from level events
         ├─ stt.rs          transcribe-rs: Parakeet (ONNX) | Whisper GGUF (whisper.cpp+Metal)
         ├─ cleanup.rs      pure filter: fillers, [artifacts], repeats, whitespace  ← R1–R4
         ├─ enhance.rs      optional localhost-only Ollama rewrite, 5 s timeout → fallback
         └─ paste.rs        clipboard save → write → ⌘V (enigo) → restore (~300 ms)
```

## Module map

**Rust host (`src-tauri/src/`)**

| Module | One purpose | Key tests |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `cleanup.rs` | Pure transcript filter (`clean(text, opts)`) + personal dictionary | R1–R4, R12 |
| `settings.rs` | Settings JSON + localhost endpoint guard | R5, R8, R13 |
| `focus.rs` | Frontmost-app capture + pure focus-guard decision | R13 |
| `sounds.rs` | Sound cues: async afplay, never on the timing path | manual |
| `registry.rs` | Data-driven model catalog (`models.json`) | R7 |
| `history.rs` | 20-entry ring buffer + retained last WAV | R6 |
| `audio.rs` | cpal capture worker thread, resampling, WAV IO | resample/WAV tests |
| `stt.rs` | Engine abstraction (Whisper/Parakeet), `load_path` for CLI | exercised by I1 |
| `downloader.rs` | Resume-able downloads, SHA-256 verify, tar.gz extract | sha/cancel tests |
| `enhance.rs` | Ollama client, warmup, timeout fallback | localhost-guard tests |
| `hotkey.rs` | handy-keys manager thread, capture mode for the recorder UI | validated via binding parse |
| `overlay.rs` | Pill window: create/show/hide/position, level throttling | E6/E8 (UI side) |
| `pipeline.rs` | The dictation state machine and delivery | manual + E-suite |
| `paste.rs` | Clipboard write + synthesized ⌘V + restore | manual (needs AX) |
| `tray.rs` | Tray icon states + menu, hotkey labels | label test |
| `commands.rs` | Tauri IPC surface (mirrored by `src/ipc/mock.ts`) | E1–E8 |

**Frontend (`src/`)**: `ipc/` (typed API + browser mock), `settings/` (four
sections + onboarding), `overlay/` (the pill), `lib/` (pure helpers — U2–U4),
`store/` (U1).

The CLI (`yat-yat transcribe|clean|bench-clean`) exposes the same engine +
cleanup code paths headlessly; the validation harness (I1/I2) drives it.

## Windows platform-abstraction boundary

Everything below compiles cross-platform today (cpal, rubato, transcribe-rs,
enigo, handy-keys, arboard, reqwest are all Windows-capable). The
platform-specific seams, each isolated in one place:

| Concern | macOS implementation | Windows port point |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Overlay window | `overlay.rs::platform` (mac): tauri-nspanel non-activating panel | `overlay.rs::platform` (non-mac) already provides the `focusable(false)` + always-on-top window; add a `SetWindowPos(HWND_TOPMOST)` reassert after show if z-order flickers |
| Paste keystroke | `paste.rs::send_paste_keystroke`: ⌘ + kVK 9 | same fn, `cfg(windows)` arm: Ctrl + VK 0x56 (already written) |
| Hotkey backend | handy-keys event tap (Accessibility) | handy-keys `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook (no permission needed) — same API |
| Permissions | `tauri-plugin-macos-permissions` + onboarding step | step is skipped on non-mac (`Onboarding.tsx` builds the step list per platform) |
| Dock + tray app | regular activation (LSUIElement dropped post-SPEC8 by owner preference; Dock click → Reopen → Settings) | standard taskbar presence + tray |
| Frontmost app (focus guard) | `focus.rs`: NSWorkspace via main thread | same fn, `GetForegroundWindow` + process name; stub currently returns `None` (guard off) |
| Sound cues | `sounds.rs`: spawn `afplay` | same fn, `PlaySoundW` with `SND_ASYNC`; stub currently no-op |
| Whisper accel | `whisper-metal` feature | swap to `whisper-vulkan` feature in Cargo target table |

Remaining Windows work is packaging (MSI/NSIS via `tauri build`), not code.

## Measured performance (SPEC §7)

Machine: Apple Silicon Mac (Darwin 25.5), release build, 2026-07-09.

| Target | Requirement | Measured |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hotkey → overlay visible | < 150 ms | `show_state` → visible: **0.29 ms** (perf probe; the handy-keys event dispatch adds single-digit ms — end-to-end is dominated by nothing) |
| Stop → text pasted (Whisper tiny) | < 1 s | jfk.wav (11 s audio): inference **97–431 ms** (warm/cold Metal) + cleanup 0.06 ms + paste delays ~450 ms ⇒ **≈ 0.6–0.9 s** |
| Stop → text pasted (Parakeet v3, 15 s) | < 1.5 s | not measurable in this run — model download blocked by the harness's no-network constraint; see BLOCKERS.md. Published benchmarks put Parakeet ~10× faster than whisper-large-turbo on ANE-class hardware |
| Idle RSS | < 400 MB warm | app idle: **102 MB**; peak RSS with Whisper tiny loaded + inferring: **228 MB** (CLI, same engine code) |
| Idle CPU | < 1 % | **0.0 %** (ps, 6 s idle) |
| Cleanup filter, 1,000 words | < 1 ms | **59.6 µs** per run (bench-clean, 100 runs) |

Model load (Whisper tiny): 4.8 s cold file cache, 154 ms warm — which is why
the active engine is loaded once and kept resident (`state.rs`), not per
dictation.

## Onboarding gates (SPEC2)

The wizard never stores a step index. A snapshot of verified facts —
`{ microphone, accessibility, captureReady, trayVisible, modelReady,
platform }` — is polled live, and the pure function
`firstUnmetStep(snapshot, skips)` (src/lib/onboarding.ts, U5-tested) decides
what to show; the wizard resumes and auto-advances from that alone. Who
verifies each fact:

| Fact | Verifier |
| --- | --- |
| `microphone` / `accessibility` | tauri-plugin-macos-permissions checks, polled 1 s |
| `captureReady` | the hotkey service is actually armed (`get_app_info` + `capture-ready` event from the lib.rs capture watcher) — accessibility is a two-fact gate |
| `trayVisible` | `tray_item_visible` (src-tauri/src/tray_probe.rs): in-process AppKit probe of the app's NSStatusBarWindow — frame width + occlusion state, on the main thread. (CGWindowList is unreliable here: macOS 26's Control Center hosts visible third-party items, so the app's own server-side window list shows a zero-size placeholder when suppressed and nothing when visible.) The wizard also offers an explicit "I can see the icon" attestation since Apple ships no public API for this state |
| `modelReady` | registry: active model set AND its files on disk |

Explicit skips (accessibility, menubar) persist in
`settings.onboarding_skips` and count as met on resume.

## Live transcription loop (SPEC3)

While recording with `live_transcription` on, a dedicated thread re-runs the
warm engine over a non-destructive snapshot of the audio so far and emits the
raw text to the overlay (`stream-text`). Cadence starts at 1 s and is governed
by `live::LiveInterval` (R10-tested): a pass costing > 60% of the interval
stretches it ×1.5 (capped at 4 s, logged once); fast passes recover it toward
1 s. Slow hardware therefore degrades to fewer updates — never to a broken
recording. **The stop path is authoritative and unchanged**: it takes the full
buffer, waits for the engine lock like any other caller, and runs the same
transcribe → cleanup → enhancement → paste pipeline; live passes can only ever
have been read-only spectators.

Measured live-pass duration on this machine (release, Metal): Whisper tiny
over the 11 s jfk.wav fixture = **97–211 ms** warm (the same numbers as I1) —
comfortably inside the 1 s base cadence; the 60% guard would not engage until
a pass exceeded ~600 ms, i.e. roughly a minute of accumulated audio at tiny's
throughput.

Flicker control lives in the frontend: `src/lib/liveText.ts` (U6-tested)
promotes words that two consecutive passes agree on (case/punctuation-
insensitive) to `stable` — stable text never shrinks and never rewrites; the
disagreeing tail renders dimmed as `tentative`.

## Overlay appearance (SPEC6)

The recording visualization is a canvas driven by `EffectEngine`
(src/overlay/effects/engine.ts) through a deliberately small renderer
interface — `init(ctx, w, h)` / `render(ctx, frame)` / `dispose()` with
`frame = { level, levels, time, dt, colors, reducedMotion, width, height }`.
15 built-ins live in src/overlay/effects/, one module each; the registry
falls back to `classic-bars` on unknown ids. (One post-SPEC6 swap: the
`vu-needle` analog meter read poorly in the wide, short pill — radial shapes
waste the horizontal canvas — so `heartbeat`, an EKG-style scrolling trace,
replaced it; saved `vu-needle` selections fall back to the default.) Rendering pauses whenever the
overlay is hidden (engine.stop on state change) and every renderer receives
`reducedMotion` to calm itself.

Colors are the theme's job: renderers draw exclusively with
`frame.colors.{primary,accent,glow}`, resolved from the `--nh-fx-*` CSS
variables on the pill root — U8 enforces "no hardcoded draw colors" at the
source level. A theme is the 11-variable contract in THEMES.md applied via
the `.nh-theme` class; 12 built-ins ship in src/overlay/themes/, and user
themes are drop-in .css files (size-capped, remote url() rejected —
src-tauri/src/themes.rs, R11) loaded through `list_user_themes`.

**User JS/TS effects are deferred deliberately**: user code in the overlay
webview needs an IPC-less sandbox and a frozen API. The renderer interface
above IS that API surface — if plugins ever land, they implement the same
contract inside a sandboxed frame, and nothing here changes.

## Focus guard (SPEC7)

Never paste into the wrong app silently. `focus.rs` is the platform boundary
for frontmost-application queries: on macOS it asks NSWorkspace (raw
`msg_send!`, marshalled to the main thread like tray_probe); the non-mac stub
returns `None`, which disables the guard entirely — the Windows port point is
`GetForegroundWindow` + process name in the same function.

The flow: `start_recording` captures the frontmost app (the overlay panel is
non-activating, so frontmost-at-hotkey IS the paste target) into
`AppState::dictation_start_app`. After STT + cleanup + enhancement —
immediately before delivery, exactly the window where users ⌘-tab away — the
pipeline re-reads the frontmost app and feeds both into the **pure decision
function** `focus::decide(enabled, output_method, started, current)` (R13
table-tests it). Same bundle id, any `None`, clipboard-only output, or the
setting off → deliver as always. Mismatch → the transcript parks in
`AppState::pending_paste`, the overlay shows the `focus-changed` prompt, and
**the pipeline thread returns to its message loop** (`AwaitFocusConfirm`
stage) — it never blocks on the human. Resolution arrives as ordinary
pipeline messages: the overlay buttons (`resolve_focus_prompt` IPC), the
dictation hotkey (= paste), Esc (= dismiss), a 10 s timeout or a preempting
new dictation (= copy + notify). History and last-transcription are recorded
*before* the decision, so every outcome keeps the text. The confirmed paste
re-checks nothing — the user just pointed at the target.

Sound cues (`sounds.rs`, same platform-boundary pattern) and the red
recording tray dot (`tray.rs` renders the recording state non-template) are
the other SPEC7 surfaces; cue playback is spawn-and-forget (`afplay`), never
on the dictation path's critical timing.

## Release pipeline (SPEC8)

The app version lives in exactly three files — `package.json`,
`src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml` — moved only in
lock-step by `npm run release:prepare -- <semver>` (pure rewrite transforms,
U12-tested; pre-release ids like `-alpha.1` are never stripped; lockfiles
refresh alongside). Tags mirror the files.

`.github/workflows/release.yml` topology: a tag push (`v*`) or a
`workflow_dispatch` dry-run → **test** (macos-latest: version-drift check,
then the full `npm run validate` gate, with the I1 model cached via
actions/cache) → **build-macos** (Apple Silicon dmg) → **release** (checksum
file + one **draft** GitHub Release, exactly two assets, 80 MB guard).
Publishing is always a human flipping `--draft=false` after smoke-testing —
see docs/RELEASING.md.

Licensing guard: `npm run licenses` regenerates THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md from
`package-lock.json` + `cargo metadata` and fails on any license outside the
permissive allowlist (U13-tested, including the tauri-nspanel
missing-metadata override) — copyleft can't enter the bundle unnoticed.

Updater (SPEC9): **Check for Updates…** (app menu + tray) shows the
settings window and emits `check-updates`; the dialog drives the
`src/ipc/updates.ts` seam — `tauri-plugin-updater`/`-process` on desktop
(all network Rust-side, user-initiated, minisign-verified against the
pubkey in tauri.conf.json), a `window.__yyUpdate` mock in the browser
(E15a/E15b). Release builds emit signed `.app.tar.gz` updater artifacts and
a `latest.json` composed by `scripts/updater-manifest.mjs` (pure core,
U14); publishing a release advances the rolling `updater` release that the
fixed endpoint points at (`updater-manifest.yml`).

## Design notes

- **One pipeline thread** serializes Idle→Recording→Processing, so double
  hotkey presses, Esc, menu clicks, and the 5-minute watchdog can't race.
- **The overlay never takes focus**: NSPanel with `nonactivating_panel` +
  `can_become_key_window: false`; levels are throttled and skipped entirely
  while hidden (hidden WebKit views still pay for every event).
- **Paste runs on the main thread** (macOS requirement), with the previous
  clipboard restored ~300 ms after ⌘V; missing Accessibility degrades to
  clipboard-only plus a notification.
- **The mock IPC shim** (`src/ipc/mock.ts`) mirrors `commands.rs` event-for-
  event, which is what lets Playwright drive the real settings/overlay UI in a
  plain browser.
- Patterns for the hard parts (bare-modifier hotkeys, non-activating overlay,
  clipboard restore timing, download state machine) were adapted from
  [Handy](https://github.com/cjpais/Handy) (MIT), with thanks.
